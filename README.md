Sentiment analysis remains a core task in NLP in which the objective is sentiment prediction of a given text as either neutral sentiment, a positive sentiment or a negative sentiment. In this project, to classify the IMDB movie review data based on their sentiment, we use a BERT model. BERT is a transformer-based pre-trained model which has performed best being pre-trained on a vast amount of text. As for the sequence classification, the BERT model will be utilized to classify the sentiment of movie reviews by fine-tuning it on the IMDB dataset.


For this project, the movie review dataset from IMDB has been used. This dataset is made of approximately 50,000 reviews either labelled as positive or negative. The data is further divided into training and testing sets with; around 45,000 entries in the training set and around 5,000 for testing. The link to the dataset is as follows:
